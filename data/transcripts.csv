It then looks at itself in the river and feels around its belly, revealing to be Steven in a Watermelon Steven's body. Steven opens his mouth, spitting out a few seeds with a growl, and quickly covers it. Steven then grunts even more, spitting out more seeds, and spins around in confusion. Steven sits down, mumbling to himself, when the ground rumbles a bit. A dog barking is heard, as a Melon Mutt jumps out of a nearby bush. It bounces along the ground, shakes its tail and rolls over to Steven. Steven pets the Mutt and it begins to lead Steven across the river, through the forest, and into the Watermelon village. Steven arrives at the village, seemingly a humble farming village, where several Watermelon Stevens are cultivating Baby Melons and then distributing them to Watermelon Steven families to raise as their own. Steven tours around the village, seeing Watermelon Stevens doing recreational activities, such as hacky sack, drumming and dancing. The Melon Mutt leads Steven to a giant statue in the middle of the village, resembling Baby Melon, where a Watermelon Steven elder is educating other Baby Melons about Baby Melon's sacrifice. Suddenly, a tremor happens again, startling the wildform on the island. A Watermelon Steven begin hitting a gong in a constant rhythm, and all the Watermelon Stevens gather around the Baby Melon statue. The elder shakes its stick, prompting all the Watermelon Stevens, including Melon Mutt, to touch their noses. Only Steven, unknowingly, did not follow and the elder points its stick at him. The Watermelon Stevens paints a yellow star on Steven's chest and gives him a flower crown. They then carry Steven on a wooden chair to a cliff and leaves him alone there. The Watermelon Stevens hide behind a geode arch and Steven growls at them in confusion. A Watermelon Steven then assures the pose of Baby Melon, hinting to Steven, and he takes the pose too, facing out to the sea. The tremor occurs again, as Malachite rise from the sea.

Kindergarten Kid,,[],,,"Peridot removes another leg, resulting in the aforementioned result."

Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],Keep distracting it! I'll finish it off!,,

Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,['starts banging her fist on the cannon'],"Huh?  Work, you stupid- Argh!",,
Kindergarten Kid,,[],,,"The cannon fires, the resulting recoil sending it backwards into Peridot, crashing her into the wall behind her and creating a mini-avalanche of boulders. The Tongue Monster then approaches Steven."

Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],"Okay. I've analyzed the problems with the previous two Peri-plans. Relying on the Injectors introduced too many complicating variables. Now we only have to rely on simple physics! We'll wait until it gets right up under us, not suspecting a thing, because it's so dumb! And then we'll drop this rock on its stupid head! It's even more flawless! And at this height, nothing can fall on us!",,

Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],"I'm doing the best I can, Steven!",,

Kindergarten Kid,,[],,,"The giant boulder falls onto Peridot, flattening her onto it, and rolls off carrying her away.

Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,['sits down next to Steven in frustration'],Why can't I master this?,,

Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],"Okay, just to make sure my Earth vocabulary is correct on this... let's say I'm a monster. I spend all my time slamming my face into hard objects and throwing my tongues in the air for fun. How am I not... dumb?",,

Kindergarten Kid,,[],,,Peridot frowns in sheer embarrassment.
Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],It's luck! Nothing that thing does makes any sense!,,
Kindergarten Kid,,[],,,Peridot kicks away a nearby stone and begins to ponder in frustration. Steven then throws a piece of marshmallow at Peridot.
Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],Hey.,,
Kindergarten Kid,,[],,,Steven taunts the anticipation of another marshmallow and throws another one at Peridot. He eventually starts throwing dozens of them at Peridot.
Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,['growling angrily'],Why are you bombarding me with your confectionery puff rocks?!,,

Kindergarten Kid,,[],,,"Peridot keeps growling in anger as Steven throws marshmallows at her, She eventually breaks and snatches the marshmallows bag away from Steven. She chews on the bag and waves it around in a fit of anger like a wild dog, proving Steven's point."
Kindergarten Kid,Steven,[],There! You see?,,
Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],Yeah.,,
Kindergarten Kid,Steven,[],What you're doing makes total sense! You remember what it was like to have everything important taken away? Being under attack? Feeling trapped? You were frustrated. So is she! Why don't you try thinking about all of this from her point of view?,,
Kindergarten Kid,Peridot,[],Hmm...,,

Gem Heist,Sapphire,[],You're accompanying me as extra muscle.,,
Gem Heist,Amethyst,['points at the Amethyst guards'],Muscle like them?,,
Gem Heist,Sapphire,[],Exactly.,,
Gem Heist,Amethyst,[],But I've never even seen another Amethyst before. What do I do? What if I say something wrong?,,
Gem Heist,Sapphire,[],"Just look the part. You're new and we're rusty, but we just have to sell this long enough to find Greg.",,

Gem Heist,Guards,[],Forgive us!,,
Gem Heist,,[],,,Holly Blue punches the guards to correct them.
Gem Heist,Guards,[],"... Forgive us, your Clarity!",,
Gem Heist,Sapphire,[],No use dwelling on the past. I've brought a new human for the collection.,,

Gem Heist,,[],,,Ruby quickly shushes Steven.

Gem Heist,Holly Blue,[],"Hmm. Chatty. (Pearl blushes.)

Gem Heist,,[],,,"Holly Blue reverts the floor back to its original state, and the group continues touring."
Gem Heist,Holly Blue,[],It's tragic that Pink Diamond's existence in this universe ended up being so finite. But what a selfless act for Blue Diamond to step forward and spend her own time and energy preserving this place in Pink Diamond's memory.

Gem Heist,Holly Blue,[],"Oh, there it goes again with its hilarious noises.",,
Gem Heist,Sapphire,[],"So, how do you get in the zoo?",,

Gem Heist,Ruby,[],Got it.,,

Gem Heist,Holly Blue,[],My word! I don't know why anyone trusts Rubies with those ships! This is what happens.,,

Gem Heist,Steven,[],Okay.,,
Gem Heist,Ruby,[],"And Pearl, hack faster.",,
Gem Heist,,[],,,"Pearl continues to hack the door panel while Steven and Ruby tries to bash down the door. Sapphire's voice can then heard, as she and Holly Blue begin to return."

Gem Heist,,[],,,"More Gem fingers appear and begin performing health checks on Steven, such as dental hygiene, photon sensitivity in the pupils, temperature, and nasal congestion. They then begin stripping Steven off of his clothes down to his pants, and which Steven smacks the fingers away."

He roars loudly in distress, causing birds to fly off the island in shock. Steven gets up and begins walking through the forest, disappointed he has entered a situation he did not want, when Melon Mutt pops out from the bushes and pounces on Steven. Steven pulls Melon Mutt off his face, when he spots some Watermelon Stevens, all with yellow stars painted on their bellies like he is, marching in a line. He follows the W.S.s into a village, modeled in the image of Baby Melon. The W.S. villagers are then seen gathering the statue of Baby Melon. A W.S. elder prompts them to assume the pose of Baby Melon and they all bask in the presence of Baby Melon's statue, much to Steven's annoyance. Steven tries to converse with the W.S.s, but one of them, wearing a farmer hat, shushes him. Steven then stomps off in annoyance. Steven walks up to the cliff and gazes out to the ocean, as Melon Mutt runs to his side. Steven proceeds to dives into the ocean and begins swimming, attempting to reach Beach City this way. However, his light body gets washed back ashore on Mask Island, where the farmer W.S. is watching. Steven attempts to draw a picture of the Crystal Temple on the beach, but the farmer W.S. draws the statue of Baby Melon in response, and Steven drops to his knees in dejection. He then draws a small picture of a raft in the sand and runs into the forest, while the farmer W.S. cries out to him with unease. In the forest, Steven begins gathering a stack of sticks while Melon Mutt follows him. He hops over to the other half of the island and spots a stick stuck in the ground. He pulls it out of the ground, only to find it is a spear. Suddenly, a W.S., wielding a shield and wearing war paint on its face, pops out in front of Steven. It snatches the spear from Steven and shortly, Steven finds himself surrounded by more W.S.s. The W.S.s proceed to lead Steven and Melon Mutt into another village, garrisoned and heavily guarded. The W.S.s bring Steven and Melon Mutt towards the statue in the village, modeled after the both of them for their bravery. A W.S. chieftain walks in, wielding a giant spear, and points it at Steven. The W.S.s proceed to wipe the yellow star off his belly and apply war paint on his face, much to Steven's displeasure. Steven tries to wrestle back his stack of sticks from the Spear W.S.s, when the W.S. elder suddenly walks in, along with the Star W.S.s. The Star W.S.s begins to lead Steven out of the village, but the Spear W.S.s blocks their paths. Vastly irritated, Steven wipes off his face war paint and slips away. The Spear W.S.s begin provoking the Star W.S.s, all while the Star W.S.s simply stand in pose of Baby Melon. Steven shakes his head in disapproval of the dispute and walks off. The farmer W.S. from before and a Spear W.S. notice Steven and follow him to the beach. On the beach, Steven begins constructing a raft with the sticks, but is unsuccessful due to his stubby melon hands. He then begins to tear up in defeat, when Melon Mutt, the farmer W.S. and the spear W.S. approach him. The W.S.s notice Steven's drawing of a raft in the sand and begin putting the sticks together, much to Steven's delight. More W.S.s then joins in to help Steven construct the raft. Just then, the W.S. chieftain, provoking the W.S. elder, walk in. The W.S.s proceed to take the chieftain's spear and the elder's cape away to construct the sail, completing Steven's raft. The W.S.s all clap in triumph and Steven begins setting sail out to sea, waving the W.S.s farewell. 'Steven sails happily towards Beach City, when a storm suddenly brews overhead, and Steven struggles to control the raft. After the storm calms, the raft comes to a standstill in the middle of the sea. Steven tries to blow at the sail, but spits out watermelon seeds instead. He then sits in disappointment at the edge of the raft, when a Melon Shark suddenly attacks, destroying the raft, biting off his leg and plunging him underwater. Steven however succeeds in calming the Melon Shark down by patting it and kissing it, causing it to blush and swim away. Steven swims to the water surface, grabs onto a driftwood from his raft and begins paddling his way to Beach City. Time passes on, Steven's melon body begins to rot under the hot sun, causing him to lose an arm. Night quickly falls, Steven floats in exhaustion in the middle of the sea, when Lion pops in, standing on the water surface. Steven grunts in relief at the sight of Lion. Lion licks Steven, places him onto his back and begins running towards Beach City."

Steven begins to converse verbally to Greg, Bismuth and Lion, who are unable to understand what he is saying as a Watermelon Steven. Greg hands Steven a stick and he begins to draw on the sand. He illustrates the events of ""Together Alone"" in the sand, to which Greg and Bismuth still cannot understand. Steven, annoyed, draws in the sand again, this time writing in words, reading ""Help! We Need Backup!"", and Greg and Bismuth finally understand Steven's message. Steven gives a thumbs-up and collapses onto the sand.

The Future,,[],,,"""Being Human"" plays as Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl continue to wave after their departing friend. In front of the Big Donut the townspeople hold a banner saying ""Bye Steven"" and wave after him. Steven waves back at them as they yell their final goodbyes as he turns the corner, passing the car wash. Steven turns up the radio and begins to drive out of Beach City and towards his distant future. Our view moves up into the night sky as the stars glistening. Fade to black as the credits roll."
